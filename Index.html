                Anime has its roots in early 20th-century Japan. The earliest known anime films date back to 1917, with works like "Namakura Gatana" and "Katsud≈ç Shashin". These early animations were influenced by traditional Japanese art forms and storytelling techniques, such as emakimono and kagee.
